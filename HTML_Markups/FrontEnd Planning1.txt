Frontend Planning 1: 

---> The frontend should ideally be a single page web app, which can be powered by React. 

---> There are several challenges that must be addressed in the frontend: 

    1. Modification of the Twit endpoints and functionality: 

        ---> Should the tweet data be obtained by the user's account? 

        ---> Or should tweet data be obtained through a geolocator endpoint usage? 

        ---> How should the information be entered into the app and what organizational principal should be used to bundle the tweets? 

            ---> The information should be entered as a subject within a region? 

            ---> Should the information be entered and correlated to trending topics on twitter? 

    
    2. The division of functionalities in the SPA: 

        ---> Should the entire process be regulated to just a single press of a button (ie tweet gathering ---> NN processing ---> Article Displays)>

        ---> Or should the entire process be divided into different phases of functionality moderated by different buttons?

        ---> These questions will ultimately depend on the 'paradigm' of the app: 

            ---> Is the app meant to be a more streamlined user experience that serves news directly? 

            ---> Or is the app meant to be more of an explanatory app that guides the user through the entire experience?
